# Slackli
A simple Slack CLI for administrators of Slack Teams. 

Slackli's goal is to provide a way for administrators to quickly notice annoying Slack administration problems from the CLI and solve (sometimes). 

Its inspiration comes from channel sprawl and my lack of interest in managing channels through the UI. 

## How to Used

TODO make this easily installed as a gem.
